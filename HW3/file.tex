\section*{Problem 1}
Let $C_{ij}$ be the event that 
the ith person grabs the jth person's coat, then we have that 
in order for all of them to have grabbed the wrong coat we could
have two possible sequences, 
$C_{13}C_{21}C_{32}$ or $C_{12}C_{23}C_{31}$, both of these cases
can happen with probability $\frac{1}{6}$ therefore the probability
that everyone grabs the wrong coat is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$
\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
$$\boxed{\frac{1}{1000}}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
Since $1003$ is not in the range of pages
then the probability
$$P(X=1003)=\boxed{0}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
$$\boxed{\frac{1}{1000}}$$
\subsection*{(d)}
There are 123 possible pages
therefore
$$P(X\leq 122)=\boxed{\frac{123}{1000}}$$
\subsection*{(e)}
$$P(12\leq X\leq 17)=\boxed{\frac{6}{1000}}$$
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
$$P(X=j)=\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{j-1}\frac{1}{5}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
$$P(X=j)=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}, j=1,2,3,4,5}$$
\section*{Problem 4}
\subsection*{(a)}
Let the bernoulli random variable $X_i$ be the event 
that the ith plate is isolated, then we have that 
$$P(X_i=1)=\frac{10}{14}\frac{9}{13}\frac{5}{15}3=0.4945$$
Therefore 
$$E[X]=15E[X_i]=\boxed{7.417}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
Let the bernoulli random variable $Y_i$ be the event
that the ith plate is semi happy, then we have
$$P(Y_i=1)=2\frac{10}{13}\frac{5}{15}\frac{4}{14}3=0.439$$
Therefore
$$E[Y]=15E[Y_i]=\boxed{6.593}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
Let the bernoulli random variable $Z_i$ be the event
that the ith plate is joyous, We have
$$P(Z_i=1)=1-P(X_i=1)-P(Y_i=1)=0.0665$$
Therefore
$$E[Z]=15E[Z_i]=\boxed{0.989}$$
\section*{Problem 5}
\subsection*{(a)}
$$\boxed{(1-p)^{n-1}p}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
$$\boxed{(1-p)^{n-2}p^2}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
The success are distrubted in a way that
is independent on where it occurs so 
the probability that the $k$ success occurs at 
$j_1,j_2,\dots,j_k$ is always the same no matter what
$j_1,j_2,\dots,j_k$ so long as $0<j_1,j_2,\dots,j_k\leq n$
\section*{Problem 6}
\subsection*{(a)}
Let the number of accidents be denoted by a random variable
$N$. $N$ is distributed as a possion random variable with
$\lambda=3$. Therefore
$$P(N=5)=\boxed{\frac{3^5e^{-3}}{5!}}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
$$P(N<3)=e^{-3}\left(1+\frac{12}{5!}\right)$$
\subsection*{(c)}
$$P(N\geq 2)=1-P(N<2)=\boxed{1-e^{-3}\left(1+\frac{3}{5!}\right)}$$
\section*{Problem 7}
\subsection*{(a)}
Rate for 1 hr for fans of both teams is $14$ per hour,
so for 3 hours it would be $\boxed{42}$.
\subsection*{(b)}
if the rat is $14$ per hour, then the rate for 
20 minutes would be $14/3$ per 20 minutes, since this will
still be distrubuted as a Poisson we have that the probability 
of only 1 fan of either the Yankees or the Red Sox enter the store
is just $\boxed{e^{-\frac{14}{3}}\frac{14}{3}}$.
\section*{Problem 8}
\subsection*{(a)}
There are $N\choose n$ ways to pick out $n$ balls from the $N$
balls in the urn. But to choose k blue balls from the $b$ balls
we have $b\choose k$ ways to do so, and we have 
$r\choose n-k$ ways to choose the remaining $n-k$ red balls. Therefore the 
probability of choosing $k$ blue balls is
$$\boxed{\frac{{b\choose k}{r \choose n-k}}{{N\choose n}}}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
\begin{align*}
    \lim_{N,b,r\to \infty}\frac{{b\choose k}{r \choose n-k}}{{N\choose n}}&=
        \lim_{N,b,r\to \infty}{n\choose k}\frac{b\cdot(b-1)\cdots (b-k+1)\cdot r\cdot (r-1)\cdots (r-(n-k)+1)}{N\cdot (N-1)\cdots (N-k+1)}\\
        &=\lim_{N,b,r\to \infty}{n\choose k}\frac{b^k\cdot r^{n-k}}{N^n}\\
        &={n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align*}
