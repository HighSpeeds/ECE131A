\section*{Problem 1}
Let $C_{ij}$ be the event that 
the ith person grabs the jth person's coat, then we have that 
in order for all of them to have grabbed the wrong coat we could
have two possible sequences, 
$C_{13}C_{21}C_{32}$ or $C_{12}C_{23}C_{31}$, both of these cases
can happen with probability $\frac{1}{6}$ therefore the probability
that everyone grabs the wrong coat is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$
\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
$$\boxed{\frac{1}{1000}}$$
