\section*{Problem 1}
We have that assuming the number of pens is large, 
then the total lifetime of the pens is distributed according to
a normal with mean $n$ and variance $n$ therefore we have that we want
to find a $n$ such that 
$$-2.32635=\frac{15-n}{\sqrt{n}}$$
solving this we get that $n=27.11$ therefore the student would need
$\boxed{28}$ pens in order for the probability of having a pen 
to run out during a semester to be greater than $0.99$
\section*{Problem 2}
The number of errors in 100 transmission can be estimated
as a normal distribution with mean of 15 and variance of $100\cdot0.15\cdot0.85=12.75$,
therefore the probability of having more than 20 errors has a corresponding 
$Z$ value of $0.392$ and therefore a corresponding probability of
$\boxed{0.65247}$.
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have that 
$$\Sigma^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{3}{5}&\frac{1}{5}\\ \frac{1}{5}&\frac{2}{5}\end{bmatrix}$$
And 
$$det(\Sigma)=5$$
Therefore we have that 
$$\Sigma^{-1}(\mu-X)=\frac{1}{5}\begin{bmatrix}
    3(\mu_1-x_1)+(\mu_2-x_2)\\
    (\mu_1-x_1)+2(\mu_2-x_2)
\end{bmatrix}$$
and therefore we have that
$$(\mu-X)^T\Sigma^{-1}(\mu-X)=\frac{3}{5}(\mu_1-x_1)^2+\frac{2}{5}(\mu_2-x_2)(\mu_1-x_1)+\frac{2}{5}(\mu_2-x_2)^2$$
Therefore we have that
$$f(x_1,x_2)=(2\pi)^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{det(5)}}e^{-\frac{3}{10}(\mu_1-x_1)^2-\frac{1}{5}(\mu_2-x_2)(\mu_1-x_1)-\frac{1}{5}(\mu_2-x_2)^2}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that Y is distributed as an normal distribution with 
mean $A\mu+B=4$ and variance $A\Sigma A^T=3$ therefore we have that
the pdf of $Y$ is 
$$f(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi3}}e^{-\frac{(y-4)^2}{6}}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
Therefore we have that given that $Z$ is a standard normal distribution
$$P(Y\geq 2)=P(Z\geq \frac{2-4}{\sqrt{3}})=1-0.12425=\boxed{0.87575}$$
\section*{Problem 4}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have that 
$$Cov(Y_i,Y_i)=2$$
and when  $i\neq j$
$$Cov(Y_i,Y_j)=1$$
Therefore we have that the covariance matrix is 
$$\Sigma=\begin{bmatrix}
2&1&1\\
1&2&1\\
1&1&2
\end{bmatrix}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that the pdf of $Y$ is
$$f(y_1,y_2,y_3)=(2\pi)^{-\frac{3}{2}}\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{1}{4}(y_1y_2+y_2y_3+y_3y_1)
-\frac{3}{8}(y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2)}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
We have that the distirbution for $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ is a 
given by a linear transformation of $[Y_1,Y_2,Y_3]$ with 
$A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\end{bmatrix}$. Therefore we have 
that this mu is $A\mu=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$ and
the covariance matrix is $A\Sigma A^T=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\1&2\end{bmatrix}$.
Therefore we have that 
$$f(y_1,y_2)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}e^{-\frac{1}{3}(y_1^2+y_2^2-y_1y_2)}$$
Likewise we have that the distribution for $Y_1$ and $Y_3$ is a
given by a linear transformation of $[Y_1,Y_2,Y_3]$ with
$A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$. Therefore we have
that this mu is $A\mu=\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$ and
the covariance matrix is $A\Sigma A^T=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\1&2\end{bmatrix}$.
Therefore we have that
$$f(y_1,y_3)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}e^{-\frac{1}{3}(y_1^2+y_3^2-y_1y_3)}$$
\subsection*{(d)}
we can simply use a linear transformation $A=\Sigma^{-1}=
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{3}{4}&-\frac{1}{4}&-\frac{1}{4}\\ -\frac{1}{4}&\frac{3}{4}&-\frac{1}{4}\\ -\frac{1}{4}&-\frac{1}{4}&\frac{3}{4}\end{bmatrix}$.
and with this we will have the resulting covariance matrix is 
$I$.
