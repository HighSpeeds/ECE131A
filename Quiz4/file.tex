\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have that the corresponding standard score is 
$z=\frac{5-4}{0.75}$
And thus we have that the probability that a blade of grass
is 5 inches or taller is 
$$P(Z\geq\frac{4}{3})=1-0.90878=\boxed{0.09122}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that the probability of picking up a blade of
grass that is 5 inches or taller is $0.09122$. so the number
of blades of grass a child would need to pick up before reaching 
a blade of grass that is 5 inches or taller is a geometric random
variable with parameter $0.09122$. Thus the expected number of blades
is $1/0.09122=\boxed{10.9625}$
\subsection*{(c)}
This is a binomial random variable, with $n=10$ and $p=0.09122$.
Thus the expected number of blades of grass that are 5 inches or taller
is $np=\boxed{0.9122}$
\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
$$E[X]=\int_{0}^{10}x\frac{(10-x)^3}{2500}dx=\boxed{2}$$
$$E[X^2]=\int_{0}^{10}x^2\frac{(10-x)^3}{2500}dx=\frac{20}{3}$$
$$Var(X)=\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
Using the central limit theorem, we can approximate the 
distribution of the sum of 200 of these random variables
as a normal distribution with mean $200\cdot2=400$ and variance
$200\cdot\frac{8}{3}=533.33$. Thus the standard
score of $420$ is
$$z=\frac{420-400}{\sqrt{533.33}}=0.866028110127$$
Thus 
$$P(Z>z)=1-0.80676=\boxed{0.19324}$$
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
We have that
\begin{align*}
    F(X,Y)&=\int_{0}^{x}\int_{0}^{y}f(x,y)dydx\\
    &=\int_{0}^{X}\int_{0}^{Y}(x+y)dydx\\
    &=\int_{0}^{X}xY+\frac{Y^2}{2}dx\\  
    &=\boxed{\frac{X^2Y}{2}+\frac{Y^2X}{2}}
\end{align*}
And thus we have that 
$$F(1,1)=\boxed{1}$$
Which is what we intuitively expect.
\subsection*{(b)}
We have that
$$f(x)=\int_{0}^{1}f(x,y)dy=\int_{0}^{1}(x+y)dy=\boxed{x+\frac{1}{2}}$$
and 
$$f(y)=\int_{0}^{1}f(x,y)dx=\int_{0}^{1}(x+y)dx=\boxed{y+\frac{1}{2}}$$
\subsection*{(c)}
No since 
$$f(x)f(y)=(x+\frac{1}{2})(y+\frac{1}{2})\neq x+y$$
