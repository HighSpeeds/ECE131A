\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
For a specific color of paint there is only 1 way to paint the rocks, so for the 3 paints there is 
3 ways to paint the rocks. Therefore the probability of all the rocks being the same color is 
$$\frac{3}{3^6}=\frac{1}{3^5}=\boxed{0.004115226337}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
For any two colors there are $2^6$ ways to paint the rocks, but we need
to subtract $2$ for the $2$ ways to paint the rocks with the same color. 
Therefore, since there is 3 paints there is $3\choose 2$ ways to choose 2 paint
colors, Therefore the probability is
$$\frac{{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)}{3^6}=\boxed{0.2551440329}$$ 
\subsection*{(c)}
For all three colors of paint, there are $3^6$ ways to paint the rocks
but we will need to subtract the ${3\choose 2}(2^6-2)$ to 
paint the rocks exactly 2 colors and the $3$ ways to paint the rocks 
one color, so we will have the probability is 
$$\frac{3^6-3-{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)-3}{3^6}=\boxed{0.7407407407}$$

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
The probability of getting the white glove for any
draw is the same since he replaces the glove, 
therefore $P(A_j)=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$ for any $j$
\subsection*{(b)}
For the first draw the probability of getting the white glove is
just the same as $P(A_j)$ so $P(B_1)=\frac{1}{5}$\\\\
For the second draw, since if we are still drawing gloves that would
mean that he did not find the white glove, so one of the other color gloves
are gone, therefore the probability $P(B_2)=\frac{1}{4}$\\\\
For the third draw, since if we are still drawing gloves that would
mean that once again he did not find the white glove, so one of the other color gloves
is once again remove from the drawer, so $P(B_3)=\frac{1}{3}$\\\\
For the fourth draw, since if we are still drawing gloves that would
mean that once again he did not find the white glove, so one of the other color gloves
is once again remove from the drawer, so $P(B_4)=\frac{1}{2}$\\\\
For the fifth draw, since if we are still drawing gloves that would
mean that once again he did not find the white glove, so the last
other color gloves
is once again remove from the drawer, so $P(B_5)=\frac{1}{1}=1$
