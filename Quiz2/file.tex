\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
For a specific color of paint there is only 1 way to paint the rocks, so for the 3 paints there is 
3 ways to paint the rocks. Therefore the probability of all the rocks being the same color is 
$$\frac{3}{3^6}=\frac{1}{3^5}=\boxed{0.004115226337}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
For any two colors there are $2^6$ ways to paint the rocks, but we need
to subtract $2$ for the $2$ ways to paint the rocks with the same color. 
Therefore, since there is 3 paints there is $3\choose 2$ ways to choose 2 paint
colors, Therefore the probability is
$$\frac{{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)}{3^6}=\boxed{0.2551440329}$$ 
\subsection*{(c)}
For all three colors of paint, there are $3^6$ ways to paint the rocks
but we will need to subtract the ${3\choose 2}(2^6-2)$ to 
paint the rocks exactly 2 colors and the $3$ ways to paint the rocks 
one color, so we will have the probability is 
$$\frac{3^6-3-{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)-3}{3^6}=\boxed{0.7407407407}$$
