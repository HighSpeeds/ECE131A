\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
For a specific color of paint there is only 1 way to paint the rocks, so for the 3 paints there is 
3 ways to paint the rocks. Therefore the probability of all the rocks being the same color is 
$$\frac{3}{3^6}=\frac{1}{3^5}=\boxed{0.004115226337}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
For any two colors there are $2^6$ ways to paint the rocks, but we need
to subtract $2$ for the $2$ ways to paint the rocks with the same color. 
Therefore, since there is 3 paints there is $3\choose 2$ ways to choose 2 paint
colors, Therefore the probability is
$$\frac{{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)}{3^6}=\boxed{0.2551440329}$$ 
\subsection*{(c)}
For all three colors of paint, there are $3^6$ ways to paint the rocks
but we will need to subtract the ${3\choose 2}(2^6-2)$ to 
paint the rocks exactly 2 colors and the $3$ ways to paint the rocks 
one color, so we will have the probability is 
$$\frac{3^6-3-{3\choose 2}(2^6-2)-3}{3^6}=\boxed{0.7407407407}$$

\section*{Problem 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
The probability of getting the white glove for any
draw is the same since he replaces the glove, 
therefore $P(A_j)=\boxed{\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{j-1}\frac{1}{5}}$ for any $j$
\subsection*{(b)}
For the first draw the probability of getting the white glove is
just $1/5$ so $P(B_1)=\frac{1}{5}$\\\\
For the second draw we would have not have drawn the white glove in the
first draw which can happen with probability $\frac{4}{5}$ and 
then drawn it in the second draw which can happen with probability $\frac{1}{4}$,
therefore $P(B_2)=\frac{4}{5}\frac{1}{4}=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$\\\\
For the third draw we would have not have drawn the white glove in the
first draw which can happen with probability $\frac{4}{5}$ and 
then drawn it in the second draw which can happen with probability $\frac{3}{4}$,
and then drawn it in the third draw which can happen with probability $\frac{1}{3}$,
therefore $P(B_3)=\frac{4}{5}\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$\\\\
For the fourth draw we would have not have drawn the white glove in the
first draw which can happen with probability $\frac{4}{5}$ and 
then drawn it in the second draw which can happen with probability $\frac{3}{4}$,
and then not have drawn it in the third draw which can happen with probability $\frac{2}{3}$,
and then drawn it in the fourth draw which can happen with probability $\frac{1}{2}$,
therefore $P(B_4)=\frac{4}{5}\frac{3}{4}\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$\\\\
For the fifth draw we would have not have drawn the white glove in the
first draw which can happen with probability $\frac{4}{5}$ and 
then drawn it in the second draw which can happen with probability $\frac{3}{4}$,
and then not drawn it in the third draw which can happen with probability $\frac{2}{3}$,
and then not drawn it in the fourth draw which can happen with probability $\frac{1}{2}$,
and then drawn it in the fifth draw which can happen with probability $\frac{1}{1}$,
therefore $P(B_5)=\frac{4}{5}\frac{3}{4}\frac{2}{3}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{1}=\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$
\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{(a)}
For each character there are 26 lower case letters, 26 upper case letters
10 numbers, and 7 special symbols, so
for a specific entry code of length $l$ there are 
$$69^l-62^l$$. 
So therefore there are entry codes that are between 5 to 7 characters long
$$69^5-62^5+69^6-62^6+69^7-62^7=\boxed{3,976,504,472,395}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
Therefore it would take  $3,976,504,472,395ms$ or $46,000$ days or $\boxed{126}$ years to try all the possible entry codes
